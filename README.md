# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science
Create a lot of projects and algorithms using machine learning algorithms

## Types of machine learning
![alt](images/scr2.png)


The only reason that we care about machine learning is that we're able to use machines to predict results based on incoming data .

and all this categories of machine learning do that :

* Supervised
    * Classification
    * Regession
* Unsupervised
    * Clustering
    * Association Rule Learning
* Reinforcement
    * Skill acquisition
    * Real time learning 



The idea is that machine learning has diffrent categories and different ways to accomplish it's goal and topics like , neural networks , decision trees , support vector machines , k nearest neighbor are simply algorithms that are used with these subfields , in order to come to these predictions .

but to remembre that all of these what they're doing is **Trying to learn from data that recieves and predict something**

## What is machine learning

Actually machine learning is board but to keep it simple , machine learning is using an algorithm or computer , program to learn about different patterns in data , and then taking that algorithm and what it's learned to make predictions about the future using similar data .

Machine learning algorithms are also called models .

## Difference between data analysis and data science

Data analysis is looking at set of data and gaining an understanding of it by comparing different  examples , different features and making visualizations graphs , as exemple is looking for the different ingredients , and asking the questions , what all the ingredeients have in common are some of them missing something which have the most of a certain type of thing 


Data science is running experiments on a set of data with the hopes of finding actionable insights within it .

one of these experiments may be to build a machine learning model , this model might look at 10000 different sets . ingredients and 10000 different chicken dishes , then tell us based on a set of new ingredients that we have , which chicken dish these ingredients are most likely to make .

You can consider data analysis and machine learning as a part of data science
